 <br/> You affect the world by what you browse.<br/> 
<br/> Anyone who has lost track of time when using a computer knows the propensity to dream, the urge to make dreams come true and the tendency to miss lunch.<br/> <br/> The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet.<br/> <br/>  The future is still so much bigger than the past.<br/>
